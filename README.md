# webpack-react-boilerplate
A quick start with my preferred React/Webpack architecture. Includes CSS Modules, React Router 4 and Babel plugins.

This is just a boilerplate I set up, so I don't have to re-create all the code every time I want to build something, using React, because let's face it - if it's not React
it's just not front-end development (tongue in cheek).

If you want to use this, then I feel bad for you son... There are 99 thousand boilerplates, and this is just my personal preference, for no reason, other than
it's the architecture and setup that I like.

Ok ... Here's the secret sauce.

## How to get started

1) Pull the repo
2) yarn/npm install - use yarn tho because it's the new hotness
3) yarn start
4) Check that all is well
5) Build the thing you wanted to build.
6) What? You expect me to build it for you?
